## Cell 11 (v1.1): Beach Classifier Training

### ‚ùå BEFORE Enhancement

**Markdown cell:**
```markdown
# üèñÔ∏è Training Stage 1: Beach Classification Model

Train a YOLOv8 classification model to identify beach images vs non-beach images.
```

**Code cell:** (147 lines of Python code with no additional explanation)

**Problems:**
- Minimal context about what's happening
- No information about training time
- No expected metrics
- No troubleshooting guidance
- No GPU optimization tips

---

### ‚úÖ AFTER Enhancement

**New comprehensive markdown cell added BEFORE code:**

```markdown
## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Stage 1: Beach Classification Model Training

**What this cell does:**
- Trains YOLOv8 classification model to identify beach images
- Distinguishes beach scenes from non-beach scenes
- Uses transfer learning from pretrained YOLOv8 model
- Implements checkpoint resume (continues from last saved point if interrupted)
- Optimized for RTX 3080 with 32 batch size

**Model architecture:** YOLOv8n-cls (classification variant)

**Training configuration:**
- **Epochs:** 50
- **Batch size:** 32 (optimized for 10-12GB VRAM)
- **Image size:** 320√ó320 pixels
- **Learning rate:** Auto (default 0.01)
- **Workers:** 4 (parallel data loading)
- **Mixed precision:** Enabled (AMP)

**Expected training time:** 15-30 minutes on RTX 3080

**Progress indicators:**
- Epoch counter (1/50, 2/50, etc.)
- Loss values (should decrease over time)
- Accuracy metrics (should increase)
- Training speed (images/second)

**Expected final metrics:**
- **Accuracy:** >90% (goal: 95%)
- **Precision:** >90%
- **Recall:** >85%

**Outputs:**
- Model saved to: `beach_classifier_best.pt`
- Training plots in results folder
- Metrics logged to console

**Checkpoint resume:**
- If training is interrupted, re-run this cell
- It will automatically resume from `beach_classifier_last.pt`

**GPU monitoring:**
- Use `nvidia-smi` in terminal to monitor VRAM usage
- Should use ~8-10GB during training
- If OOM errors occur, reduce batch size to 16 or 8

**Troubleshooting:**
- Out of memory ‚Üí Reduce batch_size to 16 or 8
- Low accuracy ‚Üí Train for more epochs (100+)
- Slow training ‚Üí Check GPU utilization with `nvidia-smi`
```

**Code cell:** (Same 147 lines, but now with full context)

## This Pattern Applied to ALL Cells

This same level of enhancement was applied to **13 code cells** in v1.1:
1. Environment Setup
2. Conda Installation  
3. Path Configuration
4. Dataset Verification
5. Dataset Statistics
6. Package Installation
7. **Beach Classifier Training** (shown above)
8. Rip Detector Training
9. Beach Classifier Testing
10. Rip Detector Testing
11. Individual Image Testing
12. Two-Stage Pipeline
13. Video Inference

Each cell now has:
- Clear "What this cell does" section
- Expected execution time
- Configuration details
- Expected outputs
- Troubleshooting tips
- Best practices
